h3 Keynote - A new approach to learning
p For the last year and a half, I've been working hard on the same project. As a lifetime learner with a family and hobbies other than 1s and 0s, it has been hard to find extended periods of time to learn new things. If a sprint that went quicker than usual, maybe I'd work in a few hours of research time. But a few hours is often not enough time to do anything other than watch a video or two; very little hands-on time for exploration.
p But that ends now! My year and half long project is done. I am now in between projects, and so it's time to start learning.
p For a while now I've been gathering videos and tutorials in an 
    a(href='www.instapaper.com') Instapaper 
    |folder named "steveconf". My plan is to treat my research time like it is my own private conference. There will be no filler sessions at this conference - only sessions that I am interested in attending.
p I'll track all of the sessions here at pleepleus88.github.io.
p First session - Building this blog with static site generators.
