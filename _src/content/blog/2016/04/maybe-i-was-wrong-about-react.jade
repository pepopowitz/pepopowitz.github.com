snippet: Setting up a React project proved to be a challenge for me the first time I tried to learn it. It went a little better the second time around.

h3 So many places to start
p There are a lot of examples of how to set up a project with React, and very little direction on the best route. The first time I tried to do this, I ended up with a whole lot of analysis paralysis, 
    | and couldn't figure out where to even start.
h3 It depends on how you learn
p A lot of the advice you get on how to learn React and its ecosystem is to learn each individual piece, one thing at a time. Definitely DO NOT start 
    | with a "starter kit", they say. That isn't going to teach you anything, they say. 
p But suddenly in retrospect I'm realizing, that is why I struggled so much the first time I tried to learn React. I am not that kind of learner.
    | I am a "give me a real live working example and I will tweak things until they break and learn from all the mistakes I make" kind of learner.
    | And what is the best way to fire up a working example of something? Yeoman. Find a generator that fits your tech stack, and start there. 
h3 Yo let's do this
p So off to 
    a.class(href="http://yeoman.io/generators", title="yeoman.io/generators") yeoman.io/generators
    |  we go...where we search for 'react', and get....tons....and tons....of results.

p Looking through some of the results, I see one that has the things I'm looking for -  
    a.class(href="https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux", title="react-webpack-redux") react-webpack-redux
    | , which is really an extension of another generator, 
    a(href='https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack') react-webpack
    | . The things I want out of the box, and the things this generator offers out of the box, are
    ul
        li Redux
        li ES2015
        li Unit testing 
        li Sass or Less
h3 The moment of truth
p So following the directions, we install the generator via npm, then generate a new site with yeoman. 
    pre yo react-webpack-redux
p After answering a few questions for setup, comes the moment of truth. If all goes according to plan, I should be able to just start the app with 
    pre npm start
    | and HOLY CRAP I CAN AND IT JUST WORKS OH MY GEEZ HOW MUCH TIME DID I WASTE TRYING TO DO THIS THE LAST TIME!!!

h3 The verdict - Oh my goodness this actually is kind of easy!
p Well, jeez. This was so much easier than the first time I tried to set up a React project. 
    | I am very pleased. I am beyond very pleased. I am actually in complete disbelief and wish I had thought of this the first time. 
    | This makes learning React a much more tolerable proposition.
