In 2016 I got the speaking bug, but struggled a little to get into conferences. For 2017, I thought a good way to get experience was to engage at the local level.</p>
<p>So I scheduled a few meetup dates. Those events have gone really well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I submitted a good amount of abstracts to local and regional conferences, hoping to get into one or two.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-i-got-into-more-than-one-or-two">And then I got into more than one or two</h3>
<p>I started to get accepted to speak at conferences way more quickly than I expected. In 2016, my issue with conference submissions was that I couldn&#39;t get in. In 2017, my issue is the opposite. I have actually started retracting submissions from conferences, for fear of getting accepted and not having any time for my family and my training. A lucky problem to have!</p>
<h3 id="my-upcoming-schedule">My upcoming schedule</h3>
<h4 id="chicago-code-camp">Chicago Code Camp</h4>
<h5 id="april-29-chicago">April 29, Chicago</h5>
<p>I&#39;ll be presenting my &quot;Getting Started With React&quot; talk at <a href="https://www.chicagocodecamp.com/">Chicago Code Camp</a> at the end of April.</p>
<p>One thing that is interesting about speaking is that you never really know what talks will get picked up. My &quot;Getting Started With React&quot; talk was never really intended to happen - it came out of a workshop I did for our internship program at <a href="http://www.centare.com">Centare</a>, and I was reluctant to submit it anywhere. But after Chicago Code Camp, I will have given this talk more than any other talk. Crazy how that works out.</p>
<h4 id="self-conference">Self.conference</h4>
<h5 id="may-19-20-detroit">May 19-20, Detroit</h5>
<p>I will be doing my favorite talk - &quot;Code Is Communication&quot; - at <a href="http://www.selfconference.org">Self.conference</a> in May.</p>
<p>This is a really fun talk, and I&#39;m excited to get to do it again. I&#39;m also really excited about the other talks at this conference. Getting accepted to Self.conference was my first big surprise.</p>
<h4 id="open-source-north">Open Source North</h4>
<h5 id="june-8-twin-cities">June 8, Twin Cities</h5>
<p>In June, I&#39;ll be doing a revamp of my oldest talk - &quot;The Static Web Revolution&quot; - at <a href="http://opensourcenorth.com">Open Source North</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m excited about some visual updates I&#39;ll be making for the slides for this talk, playing on the &quot;revolution&quot; idea.</p>
<h4 id="that-conference">That Conference</h4>
<h5 id="august-7-9-wisconsin-dells">August 7-9, Wisconsin Dells</h5>
<p>Oh man, this is the grandaddy of them all. This conference (that conference) is the reason I wanted to start speaking. I saw Cory House speak two years ago, and realized this was what I wanted to do. Getting into <a href="https://www.thatconference.com">That Conference</a> was the first speaking goal I set.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&#39;m pretty stoked about this one. I&#39;ll be doing &quot;The Static Web revolution&quot; here as well.</p>
<h4 id="midwest-js">Midwest JS</h4>
<h5 id="august-16-18-twin-cities">August 16-18, Twin Cities</h5>
<p>Back to the Twin Cities again, this time for <a href="http://midwestjs.com/">Midwest JS</a>. I&#39;d heard great things about this conference in 2016, so I was planning on attending even if I hadn&#39;t gotten in as a speaker.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be doing a brand new talk here - &quot;Unit Testing Your React App&quot;. This talk was born out of the work I&#39;ve been doing over the last year or so, as well as a desire to learn more about Jest and Enzyme.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>A few things I&#39;ve learned from this year of craziness, so far.</p>
<h4 id="keep-submitting-">Keep submitting.</h4>
<p>I was frustrated last year, and early this year, with not getting accepted into conferences. Admittedly, some of my very early submissions were not very good. But I thought a lot of the stuff I was submitting last year and early this year was pretty good.</p>
<p>It turns out it was, because all of the talks I had picked up this year were things that had been submitted and rejected many times. Especially early on, I think the ratio of rejected to accepted is at least 5 to 1. I just knew I wanted to speak at conferences, so I pushed through the rejection, and it is paying off.</p>
<h4 id="you-never-know-which-talks-will-be-accepted-">You never know which talks will be accepted.</h4>
<p>It blows my mind how many times I&#39;ll be giving my intro to React talk. I hesitated to submit that talk every single time. I thought &quot;this is such a basic thing, they must get a ton of these, why would mine get picked?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure why. But it did, several times. So, yeah - you never know which talks are interesting to organizers. It might be the one you least expect.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-spread-yourself-too-thin-">Don&#39;t spread yourself too thin.</h4>
<p>For as many talks as I&#39;ll be doing this summer, I&#39;ve been pretty lucky with which ones have been selected. Considering the range of talks I&#39;d submitted to these events, I could have found myself with a brand new talk for every event. Luckily, I didn&#39;t, so I get to focus on nailing down just a few of them. And I only have one brand new one that I have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>For next year, I&#39;m going to make sure that I&#39;m submitting talks that I have a pretty good start on. I don&#39;t want to get stuck having to write 5 new talks over the summer. This can be a hard thing to balance when you&#39;re first starting - I just wanted to get into conferences, so I was submitting anything I thought was a good idea. But it probably makes sense to restrain those ideas a little, to make sure you don&#39;t get swamped with accepted talks that you haven&#39;t written.</p>
