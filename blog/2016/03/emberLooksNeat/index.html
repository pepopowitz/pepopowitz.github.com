<p>I am in the market for a new MV* framework in Javascript. I&#39;ve done Angular 1, many times. There are things I like about it - dependency injection is easy, meaning unit testing is easy; there is <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">good guidance</a> on style and best practices; documentation is pretty great. There are also things I don&#39;t like about it - it can be slow; the digest cycle can make me want to rip my hair out at times; writing directives can be confusing and sometimes feels a little like throwing darts at a dartboard to see what sticks. But that ship has sailed, and there are too many other frameworks to stick with Angular 1 for life. I am a breadth of knowledge guy, not depth of knowledge - and the longer I stick with one framework, the more I feel like I&#39;m falling behind.</p>
<h4 id="angular-2">Angular 2</h4>
<p>The logical framework for me is Angular 2, right? I have all that Angular 1 experience. They&#39;ve now provided good <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html">guidance on migration</a>,which is way better than when it was announced, and we all thought we&#39;d be rewriting apps from scratch. But to be honest, I haven&#39;t looked into Angular 2 a whole lot, because when I look at the examples, the views look atrocious.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> *<span class="hljs-attr">ngFor</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"#hero of heroes"</span> (<span class="hljs-attr">click</span>)=<span class="hljs-string">"onSelect(hero)"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">span</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"badge"</span>&gt;</span>{{hero.id}}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">span</span>&gt;</span> {{hero.name}}
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">some-component</span> [<span class="hljs-attr">prop</span>]=<span class="hljs-string">"someExp"</span> (<span class="hljs-attr">event</span>)=<span class="hljs-string">"someEvent()"</span> [(<span class="hljs-attr">twoWayProp</span>)]=<span class="hljs-string">"someExp"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">show-title</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<p>Good gracious, look at all those symbols. Maybe I&#39;m being a crybaby, but I can&#39;t imagine myself staring at views like that all day without (a) needing a cheat-sheet to tell me which symbol to use when, and (b) throwing up. I despise Markdown for its use of semantic symbols; the symbols in Angular 2 seem just as confusing to me.</p>
<h4 id="that-react-it-s-so-hot-right-now-">That React, it&#39;s so hot right now!</h4>
<p>First of all, most of what I&#39;ve learned so far about React, I&#39;ve learned from <a href="https://medium.com/@housecor">Cory House</a> - <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-flux-building-applications">his Pluralsight course</a> is a great place to start. This dude is an amazing speaker, and I highly recommend checking him out if you get a chance.</p>
<p>I really like a lot of things about React.</p>
<ul>
<li>The virtualDom diffing is cool. Better performance is nothing to complain about.</li>
<li>I like the concept of uni-directional flow. I&#39;ve played with both Flux and Redux, and before you get lawyery on me I know that&#39;s not technically part of React, but it is part of the ecosystem - and if you&#39;re going to build something with React, you&#39;re going to use either Flux or Redux because all of the examples do too. Flux is okay, but has too much boilerplate repetition for my tastes. Redux I find to be pretty neat - I like the <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html">guiding principles</a> - a single source of truth, read-only state, and the use of pure functions.</li>
<li>The language is simple, and it&#39;s pretty easy to figure out what&#39;s going on in a component.</li>
<li>Jsx is awesome. I love the fact that you get a compile error when you typo something in a component - as opposed to something silently failing in most other frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dislikes list is much shorter....but the one item on the list is huge. Javascript tools fatigue is a real thing, and React is the ultimate example of it. I hope you like to have opinions about everything - cuz you&#39;re gonna need to. Setting up a project in React is a painful experience. React embraces the micro-library culture of npm - so you need to pick your own libraries for pretty much everything. If you&#39;re the kind of person who wants control over every..single..feature when you buy a new car, then React is going to make you happy. I am not one of those people. I am pretty happy to have three packages to choose from. I don&#39;t want to fill out a form for two hours choosing between 2 cupholders and 3. I want a car, and I want to drive it, and I don&#39;t much care for the details. Getting up and running with React can be a challenge, and one that makes me not want to use React.</p>
<h4 id="ember">Ember</h4>
<p>Which brings me to Ember. I don&#39;t know a whole lot about Ember. In fact, most of what I know, I learned from <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/516/ambitious-ux-and-ambitious-apps-with-ember-and-lauren-tan">one episode of HanselMinutes</a>.</p>
<p>What I think I like the most about Ember is that it provides opinions for you. This is my biggest issue right now with JavaScript development - you need to have an opinion about everything. I am a breadth of knowledge guy, rather than depth of knowledge - as a result, I have more interest in learning the opinions prescribed by a framework than in forcing my own opinions onto a framework. I want my MV* framework to have opinions for me so that I can focus on building something.</p>
<p>Heck, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">the slogan on their site</a> is &quot;more productive out of the box&quot;. That is a slogan I can get behind.</p>
