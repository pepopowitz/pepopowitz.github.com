The first time I tried to do this, I ended up with a whole lot of analysis paralysis,
and couldn't figure out where to even start.</p><h3>It depends on how you learn</h3><p>A lot of the advice you get on how to learn React and its ecosystem is to learn each individual piece, one thing at a time. Definitely DO NOT start
with a "starter kit", they say. That isn't going to teach you anything, they say.</p><p>But suddenly in retrospect I'm realizing, that is why I struggled so much the first time I tried to learn React. I am not that kind of learner.
I am a "give me a real live working example and I will tweak things until they break and learn from all the mistakes I make" kind of learner.
And what is the best way to fire up a working example of something? Yeoman. Find a generator that fits your tech stack, and start there.</p><h3>Yo let's do this</h3><p>So off to<a href="http://yeoman.io/generators" title="yeoman.io/generators" class="class">yeoman.io/generators</a> we go...where we search for 'react', and get....tons....and tons....of results.</p><p><img src="../../../../static/images/yeoman-react.gif"/></p><p>Looking through some of the results, I see one that has the things I'm looking for -<a href="https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux" title="react-webpack-redux" class="class">react-webpack-redux</a>, which is really an extension of another generator,<a href="https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack">react-webpack</a>. The things I want out of the box, and the things this generator offers out of the box, are<ul><li>Redux</li><li>ES2015</li><li>Unit testing</li><li>Sass or Less</li></ul></p><h3>The moment of truth</h3><p>So following the directions, we install the generator via npm, then generate a new site with yeoman.<pre>yo react-webpack-redux</pre></p><p>After answering a few questions for setup, comes the moment of truth. If all goes according to plan, I should be able to just start the app with<pre>npm start</pre>and HOLY CRAP I CAN AND IT JUST WORKS OH MY GEEZ HOW MUCH TIME DID I WASTE TRYING TO DO THIS THE LAST TIME!!!<img src="../../../../static/images/dancing_banana.gif" style="width:200px"/></p><h3>The verdict - Oh my goodness this actually is kind of easy!</h3><p>Well, jeez. This was so much easier than the first time I tried to set up a React project.
I am very pleased. I am beyond very pleased. I am actually in complete disbelief and wish I had thought of this the first time.
This makes learning React a much more tolerable proposition.</p></article><hr><div id="disqus_thread"><script>(function() {
