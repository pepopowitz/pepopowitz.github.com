<p>There are a lot of examples of how to set up a project with React, and very little direction on the best route. The first time I tried to do this, I ended up with a whole lot of analysis paralysis, and couldn&#39;t figure out where to even start.</p>
<h3 id="it-depends-on-how-you-learn">It depends on how you learn</h3>
<p>A lot of the advice you get on how to learn React and its ecosystem is to learn each individual piece, one thing at a time. Definitely DO NOT start with a &quot;starter kit&quot;, they say. That isn&#39;t going to teach you anything, they say.</p>
<p>But suddenly in retrospect I&#39;m realizing, that is why I struggled so much the first time I tried to learn React. I am not that kind of learner. I am a &quot;give me a real live working example and I will tweak things until they break and learn from all the mistakes I make&quot; kind of learner.</p>
<p>And what is the best way to fire up a working example of something? Yeoman. Find a generator that fits your tech stack, and start there.</p>
<h3 id="yo-let-s-do-this">Yo let&#39;s do this</h3>
<p>So off to <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators">yeoman.io/generators</a> we go...where we search for &#39;react&#39;, and get....tons....and tons....of results.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/yeoman-react.gif" alt="Yeoman React search"></p>
<p>Looking through some of the results, I see one that has the things I&#39;m looking for - <a href="https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux">react-webpack-redux</a>, which is really an extension of another generator, <a href="https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack">react-webpack</a>. The things I want out of the box, and the things this generator offers out of the box, are...</p>
<ul>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>ES2015</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Sass or Less</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-moment-of-truth">The moment of truth</h3>
<p>So following the directions, we install the generator via npm, then generate a new site with yeoman.</p>
<p><code>yo react-webpack-redux</code></p>
<p>After answering a few questions for setup, comes the moment of truth. If all goes according to plan, I should be able to just start the app with</p>
<p><code>pre npm start</code></p>
<p>and HOLY CRAP I CAN AND IT JUST WORKS OH MY GEEZ HOW MUCH TIME DID I WASTE TRYING TO DO THIS THE LAST TIME!!!</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/dancing_banana.gif" style="width:200px"></p>
<h3 id="the-verdict-oh-my-goodness-this-actually-is-kind-of-easy-">The verdict - Oh my goodness this actually is kind of easy!</h3>
<p>Well, jeez. This was so much easier than the first time I tried to set up a React project. I am very pleased. I am beyond very pleased. I am actually in complete disbelief and wish I had realized it could be this easy this the first time. This makes learning React a much more tolerable proposition.</p>
