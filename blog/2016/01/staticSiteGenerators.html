As a lifetime learner with a family and hobbies other than 1s and 0s, it has been hard to find extended periods of time to learn new things. If a sprint that went quicker than usual, maybe I'd work in a few hours of research time. But a few hours is often not enough time to do anything other than watch a video or two; very little hands-on time for exploration.</p><p>But that ends now! My year and half long project is done. I am now in between projects, and so it's time to start learning.</p><p>For a while now I've been gathering videos and tutorials in an <a href="www.instapaper.com">Instapaper </a>folder named "steveconf". My plan is to treat my research time like it is my own private conference. There will be no filler sessions at this conference - only sessions that I am interested in attending.</p><p>I'll track all of the sessions here at pleepleus88.github.io.</p><p>First session - Building this blog with static site generators. </p></article></div></div></body></html>
