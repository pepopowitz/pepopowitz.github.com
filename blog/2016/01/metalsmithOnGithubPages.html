All staticgens seem to be opinionated, and that is how they manage to simplify the static generation process. Metalsmith, while opinionated, seems to be the most flexible of the staticgens I've looked at. I decided to try to build this site with metalsmith.io, and then deploy it to Github Pages. </p><h4>Conflict of interests</h4><p>All the samples for metalsmith.io show the content being generated into a "build" folder. I knew long term that I would have to change this so that the content generated into the root, but I figured "okay, well, I will just put everything into a ./build folder for now, and when it comes time to deploy to Github Pages, I can simply change the target folder to be the root." </p><p>I was wrong. </p><h4>Target content structure</h4><p>Here's what I want my structure to look like, in order to deploy to Github Pages - </p><p>.
├── _src
|   ├── content
|   |   ├── blog
|   |   |   └── 2016/01/post.jade    
|   |   └── index.jade
|   ├── layouts
|   ├── node_modules
|   ├── build.js
|   ├── package.json
|   └── site.less
├── index.html  --my generated homepage
├── blog
|   └── 2016/01/post/index.html     --my generated blog posts
└── site.css  --my generated css
</p><p>Everything in the _src folder is pre-generated, and everything else in the root is generated. Github Pages will ignore any folder that begins with _, so the only things that end up in pleepleus88.github.io are the things I want to be there.</p><h4>You cannot delete yourself</h4><p>Step 1 was to modify my build script to generate the content into the root folder. This...<div>metalsmith(__dirname)
    .source('./content')
    .use(....)
    .destination('./build')
    .build(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }
    });
</div>became this.....<div>metalsmith(__dirname)
    .source('./content')
    .use(....)
    .destination('../') 
    .build(...);
</div></p><p>This results in metalsmith trying to delete the _src folder, which is not AT ALL what I want. It gives the friendly error<pre>Error: EBUSY, resource busy or locked....</pre>So the first step to solving the problem is turning off auto-clean within my metalsmith build script.</p><p>Now my build script became this: <div>metalsmith(__dirname)
    .source('./content')
    .use(....)
    .clean(false)
    .destination('../') 
    .build(...);
    </div></p><p>This is progress, as the build succeeds! It is also the solution described in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25903167/1585069">this StackOverflow answer.</a>Unfortunately, as that answer also describes, there is NO cleanup running now, so files deleted from _src are not going to be deleted in the generated content.</p><h4>Metalsmith-cleanscript ftw</h4><p>Close to throwing in the towel, I found <a href="https://github.com/srcreigh/metalsmith-cleanscript">metalsmith-cleanscript.</a>This allows me to write a custom cleanup script, disable the default metalsmith cleanup, and use mine instead.</p><h4>Workarounds I didn't like</h4><ul><li>Don't host on Github Pages. Hosting on something like netlify.com let's you deploy a specific folder. I like netlify, but for my own blog, I wanted to use Github Pages. I like the sound of a .github.io domain.</li><li>Store the source in a separate repo, and push only the generated folder to the Github Pages repo. I'd rather keep all the datas in one repo, since they are all dealing with one site.</li></ul></article></div></div></body></html>
